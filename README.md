## Contributing

If you want to add to the list of available games / genres for Genre Defining, or add some spicy variants for Mario Variants, then feel free to open a suggestion or a pull request to add more!  
The bot simply uses the text files in `genre-defining` and `mario-variants` as it's source, so it should be extremely easy to add to if you so wish.
